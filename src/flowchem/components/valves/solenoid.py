class SolenoidValve(FlowchemComponent):
    """
    A generic solenoid valve component in the FlowChem framework.

    This class provides a simple interface to control a solenoid valve
    via HTTP API routes. It inherits from `FlowchemComponent` and
    links to a specific hardware device (`FlowchemDevice`).

    API routes exposed:
        - PUT `/open`:  Energizes the solenoid valve (opens the flow path).
        - PUT `/close`: De-energizes the solenoid valve (closes the flow path).
        - GET `/status`: Returns the current state of the valve (open/closed).

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Identifier name for the solenoid valve component.
    hw_device : FlowchemDevice
        The hardware device instance that controls the valve.
