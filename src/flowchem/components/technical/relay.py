class Relay(PowerSwitch):
    """
    Relay-based digital switch component.

    The `Relay` class represents a controllable digital on/off switch channel, typically
    implemented as a hardware relay or solid-state switch. It can be toggled between
    ON and OFF states using the Flowchem API.

    Each instance corresponds to a specific relay channel within a physical or virtual
    relay device.

    Ontology:
        - **Subclass of**: ``saref:Switch`` â€” A device capable of switching something on or off.
          (https://w3id.org/saref#Switch)
        - **Performs function**: ``saref:OnOffFunction`` or ``saref:OpenCloseFunction``

    Attributes:
        INSTANCES (dict[str, Relay]): Registry of all Relay instances, keyed by
            ``"<device_name>/<relay_name>"`` for connection tracking.

            hw_device (FlowchemDevice): The underlying Flowchem device representing the
                physical or simulated hardware interface.

        Notes:
            - The Relay is modeled as a ``saref:Switch`` performing an ``OnOffFunction``.
            - Each instance is automatically registered in ``Relay.INSTANCES`` for
              device-to-component mapping.
