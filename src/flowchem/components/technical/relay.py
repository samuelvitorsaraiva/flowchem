    Relay-based digital switch component.

    This class represents a relay box channel (digital on/off switch) that can be
    controlled through the Flowchem API. Each channel can be toggled between ON
    and OFF states, similar to how a hardware relay or solid-state switch behaves.

        - Subclass of ``saref:Switch`` â€”
          A device that can switch something on or off.
