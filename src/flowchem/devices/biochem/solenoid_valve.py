"""
BioChem solenoid valve device backed by an MPIKG switch box.

This module exposes:
- Domain-specific exceptions (`SolenoidException`, `InvalidConfiguration`)
- `BioChemSolenoidValve`, a `FlowchemDevice` that controls a single solenoid
  channel on a `SwitchBoxMPIKG` I/O board and registers a `SolenoidValve`
  component API.

Typical usage
-------------
1) Ensure a `SwitchBoxMPIKG` instance is created and registered (via
   `SwitchBoxMPIKG.from_config(...)` or equivalent) so it appears in
   `SwitchBoxMPIKG.INSTANCES` under the given `support_platform` name.
2) Initialize the valve device (`await valve.initialize()`).
3) Switch the valve state with `await valve.change_status(True/False, ...)`.
4) Query valve status with `await valve.is_open()`.

Notes
-----
- The device supports "normally open" logic. When `normally_open=True`, a
  `value=True` command opens the flow path without energizing the device (value=0),
  while `value=False` energizes the device (value=2) to close it, optionally
  entering a low-power holding mode after `switch_to_low_after` seconds.

    """
    Flowchem device that controls a single solenoid valve via an MPIKG switch box.

    This device:
      - waits for a `SwitchBoxMPIKG` instance with a matching `support_platform` name to be
        available,
      - registers a `SolenoidValve` component under the device (exposing the
        standard `/open`, `/close`, `/status` HTTP routes),
      - drives a single relay channel to set the valve state, optionally switching
        to a low-power holding mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Device identifier within Flowchem.
    support : str
        Name of the `SwitchBoxMPIKG` instance to bind to (key in
        `SwitchBoxMPIKG.INSTANCES`).
    channel : int
        Relay channel index (1–32) on the switch box.
    normally_open : bool, default True
        Electrical/flow logic of the valve. If True, the valve is open by default
        (no power). If False, the valve is closed by default (no power).

    Attributes
    ----------
    device_info : DeviceInfo
        Metadata for traceability.
    _io : SwitchBoxMPIKG
        The bound I/O board instance once initialization completes.
