    """
    Extension of the SolenoidValve class with low-power mode support.

    This component adds functionality to switch the solenoid valve 
    into a low-power holding mode after a specified delay. 
    This feature helps prevent overheating of the solenoid coil 
    during long periods of continuous operation.

    API routes exposed (in addition to SolenoidValve):
        - PUT `/switch_to_low_power`: Schedule transition to low-power mode.

        This reduces the risk of overheating by lowering

        ----------
        after : float
            Time in seconds after which the solenoid should enter
